A
Create two processes.
The first waits until the second asks the first to terminate (through signal).

B
Create two processes.
The first inputs an array of integer values, sends to the second via pipe; the second process sorts the array and prints results.

C
As before, but the second sends back the results to the first one who prints them.

D
As before, but cyclically until a special input to the first process asks to terminate the second process (through signal) and to terminate itself.
